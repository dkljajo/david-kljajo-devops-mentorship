TASK-12 Packer - > Ansible -> CloudFormation / Terrafrom

IAM User 1 ce svoje resurse da kreira unutar eu-central-1 regiona.
IAM User 2 ce svoje resurse da kreira unutar us-east-1 regiona.
IAM User 3 ce svoje resurse da kreira unutar eu-west-1 regiona

For task 12 you need to do following:

 [PACKER] - Create Custom AMI image from Amazon Linux 3 AMI image where you will have needed yum repos installed and enabled to install nginx web server and mysql database.
 [IaC - CloudFormation] Using an AMI image from step 1 create 2 new EC2 instances called task-12-web-server-cf and task-12-db-server-cf. For those instances create appropriate security groups and open needed ports. Please try to follow best practices for security groups. You can put your resources inside default VPC and public subnets.
 [IaC - Terraform] Using an AMI image from step 1 create 2 new EC2 instances called task-12-web-server-tf and task-12-db-server-tf. For those instances create appropriate security groups and open needed ports. Please try to follow best practices for security groups. You can put your resources inside default VPC and public subnets.
 [Ansible] By using ansible provisioner install nginx web server on task-12-web-server-cf and task-12-web-server-tf instances. By using ansilbe provisioner install mysql database on task-12-db-server-cf and task-12-db-server-tf instances.
You need to ensure that once when nginx is instaled that it is enabled and started. Same goes for mysql database. Also your nginx web server instances needs to have index.html file with content Hello from nginx web server created using CloudFormation and Ansible Hello from nginx web server created using Terrafrom and Ansible.


# 1. Packer
* * *

- Packer is part of the HashiCorp open source suite of toools.
- It is an open source command-line tool that allows us to create custom VM images of any OS on several platforms from a JSON file.
- Packer's operation is simple and it is based on the basic OS provided by the different cloud providers and configures a temporary VM by executing the scripts described in the JSON or HCL template.
- From this temporary VM, Packer generates a custom image ready to be used to provision VMs.
- Apart from VM images, Packer also provides other types of images such as Docker images.

# 2. CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a method of provisioning AWS infrastructure using code. 
- It allows you to model a collection of related resources, both AWS and third party, to provision them quickly and consistently. 
- AWS CloudFormation also provides you with a mechanism to manage the resources through their lifecycle.

- The created CF stack template is available in the cloudformation directory under the name cf-instances.yaml
- The following is an explanation of individual parts of the code:

# 3. Terraform
* * *

- Terraform is a command-line tool that, in its basic version, is open source, uses the **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** , is declarative, and is relatively easy to read.
- Its main advantage in the use of the same language to deploy on a multitude of cloud providers such as AWS, Google and Azure.
- Terraform has other advantages:
1. **It is multiplatform**, and it can be installed on Windows, Linux and Mac.
2. **It allows a preview of infrastructure changes before they are implemented.**
3. **It allows parallelization of operations by considering resource dependencies.**
4. **It integrates a very large number of providers.**

# 4. Ansible
* * *

- **Ansible has many advanteges from other IaC tools:**

**1. It is declarative and uses easy-to-read YAML language.
2. Ansible only works with one executable.
3. It does not require agents to be installed on the VMs to be configured.
4. A simple SSL/WinRM connection is required for Ansible to connect to remote VMs.
5. It has a teplate engine and a vault to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data.
6. It is idempotent.**

- **There are two types of Ansible invenories:**

1. Static inventory: Hosts are listed in a text file in INI ( or YAML) format;
2. **Dynamic inventory : The list of hosts is dynamically generated by an external script.
The dynamic inventory is used if we do not have the addresses of the hosts.**
